<!--
VibeLoom template: containers
Tier: system-specs (full modes only)
Purpose: global runtime/deployment topology; inter-container communication paths as structured content.
Entities: CONT-####.
Derivation rules (per DAG):
- CONT derives from BC, NFR, SNFR

Communication paths between containers are structured content within this artifact (NOT graph entities). Every communication path references valid container endpoints.

Generator guidance:
- Every container appears in the topology.
- Each CONT derives from at least one BC (semantic home) plus optionally NFR or SNFR.
- Communication paths describe how containers talk to each other (event, HTTP, RPC, etc.). They are table content, not items with IDs in the derivation graph.
- Do not list components here — components are inventoried in each container.md.
- Hosting/runtime choices can be noted in the notes column or a separate prose section.

# Containers

<!-- One-paragraph statement of the system's runtime topology. -->

## Container inventory

<!-- Each CONT is a runtime/deployment unit. Each derives from BC (semantic home) + optional NFR/SNFR. -->

## Inter-container communication paths

<!-- Structured content, not graph entities. Describes how containers talk to each other. Each row references valid container endpoints or external systems. -->
