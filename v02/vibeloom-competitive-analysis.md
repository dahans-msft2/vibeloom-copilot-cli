# VibeLoom Competitive Analysis

A comparison of VibeLoom against five spec-driven development tools — Traycer, Deep Trilogy, Tessl Framework, Kiro, and GitHub Spec Kit — focused on what actually happens to your project over time with each approach.

> **Data sources note**: This analysis draws on official documentation, creator blog posts, independent community reports (GitHub issues, Reddit, Hacker News, DEV Community), and published case studies. Claims about competitors are grounded in public user feedback. Claims about VibeLoom are based on methodology design — real-world case studies are not yet public as of March 2026. Where a claim is aspirational rather than evidenced, it is marked as such.

## The Question That Matters

Every spec-driven tool promises better AI-generated code. The real question is: **what does your project look like when it outgrows the person who started it?**

The tools in this comparison all start from a similar premise — write specs before code — but diverge dramatically in what happens as the project evolves. A prototype built by one dev over a weekend faces different problems than a product with a PM driving requirements, which faces different problems than a two-pizza team with parallel workstreams and architectural decisions that predate half the team.

This analysis follows a single product through three phases of growth, tracking what each tool delivers — and where it hits its ceiling.

---

## The Trajectory: What Happens As Your Project Grows

### Phase 1: The Prototype — 1 Dev, 1 Bounded Context, Getting to "Does This Work?"

The codebase is small (dozens of files), fits in one agent's context window, and the developer holds the entire system model in their head. Requirements are informal. Speed to first working demo matters more than architectural purity. Think: a weekend project, a hackathon, a simple internal tool, an SMB website.

**Every tool works here. The question is overhead vs. value.**

| Tool | Phase 1 Experience | Overhead | What you get for it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Traycer** | Describe task → plan with file-level detail → hand off to Cursor/Claude Code → verify. | Minimal — planning takes minutes | Verified implementation; catches obvious mistakes before commit |
| **Kiro** | Write requirements → Kiro generates design → generates tasks → agent executes. | Low-moderate — but [4 user stories with 16 acceptance criteria for a small bug fix](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) shows it can over-generate | Structured task list; auditable trail |
| **Deep Trilogy** | /deep-plan runs 30-min interview → generates sections → manually feed to Claude Code. | Significant — 30 min interview before any code | Thorough thinking about edge cases; multi-LLM review of the plan |
| **Tessl** | Write per-file spec → generate code marked `GENERATED FROM SPEC - DO NOT EDIT`. | Per-file — scales linearly with codebase | Each file stays in sync with its spec |
| **Spec Kit** | Set up constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement. | Heavy — [33 minutes and 2,577 lines of markdown to produce 689 lines of code](https://dev.to/casamia918/why-spec-driven-development-fails-and-what-we-can-learn-from-it-2pec) | Constitution enforces global standards; structured thinking |
| **VibeLoom (vibe)** | Generate intent → auto-advance system-specs → generate code. Compact contract stack (intent + flat system doc). One approval checkpoint at intent. | Low — compact stack in 10-20 min, auto-advance keeps flow moving | Governed from day one; natural upgrade path to full contract stack when the project outgrows vibe |

**Phase 1 verdict**: For a prototype, Traycer and prompt-only generation are fastest. VibeLoom in vibe mode closes the gap — a compact contract stack (intent + flat system doc) takes 10-20 minutes and gives you governed foundations with minimal ceremony. If the prototype dies, the overhead was negligible. If it survives, you upgrade to the full contract stack instead of reverse-engineering chat history.

The honest question a developer should ask: *"Is this going to survive past this weekend?"* If no, don't use VibeLoom. If maybe, vibe mode hedges the bet with minimal overhead. If yes, every minute invested in the contract stack pays compound interest.

---

### Phase 2: The Real App — 1 PM + 1-2 Devs, Multiple Features, Users Giving Feedback

The product has users. Requirements are coming from a PM who thinks in user stories and acceptance criteria, not in code. The codebase has grown to hundreds of files across multiple features. Edge cases discovered in production have forced design revisions. A second developer has joined and needs to understand the system. The PM asks: *"What does the system actually do right now?"*

**This is where spec-first tools start to crack.**

**Traycer**: Each feature was planned and verified individually. The plans were useful when written, but they're task-scoped — they exist for one implementation cycle, then become historical artifacts. The PM asks "what does the system do?" and nobody can point to a single artifact that answers it. The codebase has evolved through dozens of plan-execute-verify cycles, but there is no durable artifact that captures what the system *is*. When a new requirement touches three existing features, the dev must re-describe the relevant context in each new plan. Traycer's verification catches code-vs-plan divergence within a cycle, but cannot detect that plan #31 contradicts a decision baked into plan #7.

Community signal: developers report Traycer delivers [2-3 day tasks in 4 hours](https://dev.to/filiksyos/two-ways-of-building-with-ai-with-and-without-traycer-2lin) — but that's per-task productivity. Nobody reports on what the aggregate codebase looks like after 50 such tasks.

**Deep Trilogy**: The planning interviews were thorough, but each session started fresh. The section files from Feature 1 are on the filesystem but nothing connects them to the code that evolved since. The developer has been manually managing context between sections — running `/compact`, losing details each time. One developer [lost 3 hours of refactoring decisions when auto-compaction fired](https://pierce-lamb.medium.com/what-i-learned-while-building-a-trilogy-of-claude-code-plugins-72121823172b), retaining only 20-30% of the nuance. The new dev joining asks "why was this designed this way?" and the answer is buried in a Medium article about context window limits, not in an artifact.

**Kiro**: The requirements and design docs are feature-scoped, which helps. But they are [relatively static — the tool doesn't yet automate keeping spec and code in sync](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html). When Feature B modifies a component designed for Feature A, Feature A's design.md is not updated. The PM can read the requirements docs, which is genuinely useful for regulated environments. But task execution has become unreliable — [tasks frequently fail and retry from scratch, destroying context](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/1284). One intensive user documented [310+ hours and $620 in credits on a project estimated at 20-30 hours](https://kearai.com/agents/kiro-ai-review-aws-agentic-ide-guide), largely due to task failures and retries.

**Tessl**: Per-file specs are still in sync with code — the spec-as-source guarantee holds. But the system has grown to 80+ files, and there is no artifact describing how they relate. The PM asks "what bounded contexts do we have?" and the answer is: look at the folder structure and hope someone named things well. Tessl's evaluation framework shows [~35% improvement on individual API usage accuracy](https://tessl.io/blog/proposed-evaluation-framework-for-coding-agents/), which is real — but it cannot detect that component A's new behavior violates an invariant that component B depends on.

**Spec Kit**: The constitution is a quiet win — global constraints are consistently enforced. But per-feature specs have accumulated into a sea of markdown. Developers report they are [extremely detailed, increasing review burden — you may need AI to navigate your own specs](https://medium.com/@lookoutking/spec-driven-development-in-practice-my-experience-with-spec-kit-8f250b47d677). Token cost is real: developers on Claude Pro [$20/month hit the 5-hour rate limit just finishing a couple of tasks](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/1492). Each feature was spec'd in its own branch, so post-merge there is no unified view of how features interact.

**VibeLoom (pm mode) — designed behavior, not yet field-validated at this scale:**

This is where the methodology is designed to shift gears. The PM now owns the product-specs approval gate (prd, usm, dm). The dev owns intent and system-specs. When Feature B touches components from Feature A, the context graph should flag the affected downstream artifacts as stale. Reconciliation surfaces the conflict: the team chooses whether to amend the upstream contract or fix downstream. The PM can answer "what does the system do?" by reading prd + usm. The new dev reads dm + system-specs and gets the architecture without chat archaeology.

The overhead is real: every change starts from intent-specs and flows downward. The bet is that each change *updates the truth*, so the next change starts from accurate context instead of reconstructed guesswork. The context graph is designed to make truth-maintenance cheaper than truth-reconstruction.

What could go wrong: the contract stack becomes the bottleneck. If review and approval cycles slow iteration, the team bypasses the methodology — editing code directly, skipping reconciliation — and the contract drifts like any other spec. VibeLoom's 4-mode system (vibe for low-ceremony, pm for product-gated flow) is the mitigation, but the risk is inherent to governance. Additionally, VibeLoom requires familiarity with DDD concepts (bounded contexts, aggregates, invariants) — teams without this background face a steeper curve than with any other tool here.

---

### Phase 3: The Two-Pizza Team — 2-3 PMs + 5-6 Devs, Parallel Workstreams, Architectural Evolution

The product has matured. Multiple PMs own different product areas. Five or six developers work in parallel, sometimes on the same components. The architecture has been revised at least once — the original monolith is being decomposed, or a new bounded context has been carved out. Not everyone on the team was there at the beginning. The new architect asks: *"What are the system's invariants, and how do I know if my change breaks one?"*

**This is where the structural gaps become load-bearing.**

**Traycer**: Per-task productivity is still strong — reports of [a 5-month task done in 6 days using Epic Mode](https://traycer.ai/blog/epic-mode-turning-intent-to-code). But with 5-6 devs working in parallel, each creating their own plans, there is no mechanism to detect that Developer A's plan contradicts Developer B's plan. The team has likely built informal governance around Traycer — architecture docs in a wiki, an architect who reviews plans before handoff. Traycer is functioning as the execution layer in a manually-maintained governance stack. For teams with a strong architect, this works. The question: can you hire and retain that architect, and what happens when they leave?

**Deep Trilogy**: Not designed for this scale. The solo-developer workflow of interview → plan → section → implement doesn't extend to parallel teams. Multiple devs would each run independent planning sessions with no shared context. The "trilogy" is a personal productivity tool, not a team coordination layer.

**Kiro**: Five devs in Kiro means five independent feature-scoped spec trails. Context summarization [triggers at 33% of the window](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/4758) (not the documented 80%). For monorepos exceeding 500 files, reviewers observe [increasing context drift](https://caylent.com/blog/kiro-first-impressions). Martin Fowler observed that agents [frequently don't follow instructions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) even with extensive steering files. The feature-scoped requirements trail has compliance value — but the team still needs an external system (wiki, Confluence, architecture diagrams) to maintain system-level coherence.

**Tessl**: Per-file specs are still accurate — the spec-as-source guarantee scales linearly with files. For teams maintaining component libraries or API packages, this may be sufficient even at this scale. But for systems with cross-cutting invariants (e.g., "all price calculations must use the same rounding policy"), there is no artifact that captures or enforces this. The system's architectural coherence depends on tribal knowledge — exactly what breaks when the team turns over.

**Spec Kit**: The constitution continues to enforce global standards — and at this team size, that's genuinely valuable. Consistent security policies, coding standards, and testing requirements across 5-6 developers prevent a class of problems that other tools ignore entirely. The open-source ecosystem (83,000+ stars, 40+ community extensions) means community support and extensions cover edge cases. But per-feature specs remain branch-scoped with no post-merge unification, and the spec maintenance strategy [remains vague](https://medium.com/@lookoutking/spec-driven-development-in-practice-my-experience-with-spec-kit-8f250b47d677). At this scale, the constitution is the tool's value; the spec workflow is overhead that teams likely skip for small changes.

**VibeLoom (pm/dev/expert modes) — designed behavior, not yet field-validated at this scale:**

This is the scale the methodology is built for. Each PM owns a product area's prd + usm. The domain model (dm) is shared. The system-specs define containers and per-instance component contracts with explicit ownership. The context graph should enable:

- **Safe parallelism**: each dev loads only the contract subgraph relevant to their component, with minimal context. Module interface contracts define what crosses boundaries.
- **Cross-team coherence**: when PM A changes a requirement that affects a bounded context PM B owns, staleness propagates through the graph and surfaces the conflict before code is written.
- **Architectural evolution**: decomposing a monolith means updating the containers spec and re-deriving affected component specs. The graph shows exactly what's impacted.
- **Onboarding**: a new dev reads intent → prd → dm → system → the specific container and component specs they'll work on. Total reading: 8-10 focused documents, not a git history spanning 6 months.

The risks scale too. At this team size, governance overhead is felt by everyone. If the contract review process takes a day, 5-6 developers are blocked for a day. Mode selection becomes critical: `expert` (all-gated) for architectural changes, `pm` or `dev` for routine feature work, with delegated auto-advance handling the 80% case. The DDD prerequisite is no longer "nice to have" — the team needs shared vocabulary (bounded contexts, aggregates, ubiquitous language) or the domain model becomes a battleground.

Where VibeLoom's design structurally differs from competitors: the context graph makes drift *detectable* even when reconciliation is delayed. In every other tool at this scale, drift is invisible until it causes a production bug or a cross-team conflict. The contract stack doesn't prevent architectural disagreements — but it makes them explicit before they reach code.

## The Failure Modes: Where Each Tool Breaks

### Traycer: "The Plan Worked, But the Plans Don't Compound"

**The promise**: AI plans your work, you execute with your preferred agent, verification catches mistakes.

**The failure mode**: Each plan is an island. By the time you've executed 30 plans, the codebase has 30 plans' worth of architectural decisions embedded in code — but no artifact that unifies them. When plan #31 contradicts a constraint from plan #7, nothing detects it. Verification catches code-vs-plan divergence but not plan-vs-plan incoherence.

**Real-world signal**: Users praise individual-task productivity — reports of [2-3 day tasks completed in 4 hours](https://dev.to/filiksyos/two-ways-of-building-with-ai-with-and-without-traycer-2lin) and [one case of a 5-month task done in 6 days using Epic Mode](https://traycer.ai/blog/epic-mode-turning-intent-to-code). Operational complaints center on [planning latency](https://community.traycer.ai/), [plans exceeding downstream context windows](https://community.traycer.ai/) (e.g., Augment's 20k character limit), and [git worktree issues on re-verification](https://community.traycer.ai/). The tool delivers genuine value within a sprint; the structural question is whether 50 sprint-scoped plans compose into a coherent system — and it's fair to note that teams with a strong human architect may maintain that coherence informally.

**Who it works for**: Teams doing medium-sized features in existing, well-understood codebases where a human architect maintains the conceptual model in their head. Not suited for projects where the architecture itself is evolving.

### Deep Trilogy: "The Interview Was Great, But the Glue Is You"

**The promise**: Automate tedious orchestration while preserving human judgment at key decisions.

**The failure mode**: The orchestration between the three plugins is manual. /deep-plan produces sections; the developer manually feeds each section to Claude Code, runs /compact between them, and shepherds implementation through. The "trilogy" vision is a pipeline; the reality is three independent tools with the developer as the integration layer.

**Real-world signal**: The planning interviews genuinely surface hidden requirements — developers report thinking more deeply about edge cases. But the token overhead is significant (research + multi-turn interview + external LLM review), and context window limits mean [Claude's output degrades at 20-40% of the window before hitting hard limits](https://pierce-lamb.medium.com/what-i-learned-while-building-a-trilogy-of-claude-code-plugins-72121823172b). Auto-compaction is lossy. There is no lifecycle beyond the current planning session — no drift detection, no reconciliation, no formal connection between last month's plan and this month's code.

**Who it works for**: Individual developers on Claude Code who want rigorous upfront planning for complex features and don't mind the token cost. Best when features are self-contained enough that cross-session context loss doesn't matter.

---

### Tessl: "Each File Is Perfect, But the System Isn't"

**The promise**: Spec-as-source eliminates drift by making specs the only editable artifact. Code is always derived.

**What works — and this is genuinely clever**: The spec-as-source principle solves the spec-drift problem within its scope by construction, not by discipline. You can't have code drift from a spec if the spec *is* the source. Code marked `GENERATED FROM SPEC - DO NOT EDIT` stays in sync because it's regenerated, not maintained. For individual files and components, this is the strongest anti-drift guarantee in the entire landscape — stronger than VibeLoom's reconciliation, which depends on the team actually running it.

**The structural limitation**: The abstraction level is one-spec-per-file. This eliminates drift within a file but provides no mechanism for cross-file contracts, bounded-context invariants, or system-level architectural coherence. When the system grows to 80+ files, the developer needs to understand how files relate — and that understanding lives nowhere in the spec layer.

**Real-world signal**: ElevenLabs [doubled their agent success rate using Tessl tiles for API usage](https://www.producthunt.com/products/tessl). Individual-file accuracy genuinely improves. But multiple sources raise the [waterfall concern](https://marmelab.com/blog/2025/11/12/spec-driven-development-waterfall-strikes-back.html): detailed upfront specs delay the only thing that matters — user feedback. And [one analysis](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/is-ai-a-bubble-i-didnt-think-so-until) draws the TDD parallel: despite proven benefits, TDD adoption remains under 20% after 20 years, suggesting SDD may face a similar ceiling. Tessl is still in beta; the evaluation framework is promising but [questions remain about whether it captures real-world effectiveness](https://www.producthunt.com/products/tessl).

**Who it works for**: Teams maintaining component libraries, API packages, or SDK code where per-file accuracy matters most. Not suited for systems where the hard problems are cross-cutting concerns, invariants that span multiple components, or architectural coherence.

### Kiro: "Structured Start, Unstructured Continuation"

**The promise**: An IDE that enforces requirements → design → tasks before implementation, producing auditable, traceable development.

**The failure mode**: The three-doc workflow (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) is feature-scoped and forward-only. Requirements are generated, design is generated, tasks are executed — then the docs become static. When a later feature modifies the same components, the original design.md is not updated. Over time, the collection of feature-scoped design docs becomes unreliable as a description of the system.

Task execution reliability is the acute pain point. Developers report [tasks frequently failing with "unexpected error, please retry"](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/3042), and retries [lose all context and restart from scratch](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/1284) — meaning you pay the compute cost again without the benefit of prior work. Context summarization triggers [much earlier than documented](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/4758). For larger monorepos (500+ files), reviewers observe [increasing context drift](https://caylent.com/blog/kiro-first-impressions).

Martin Fowler observed that agents in Kiro [frequently don't follow all the instructions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html) even with extensive steering files — a structural problem that spec-generation cannot solve if the executing agent doesn't honor the spec.

**Who it works for**: Teams building well-scoped features in regulated environments where the audit trail matters (the spec trail from requirements to tasks is genuinely valuable for compliance). Also teams already in the AWS ecosystem. Not suited for projects where requirements evolve continuously or where the architecture itself is the hard problem.

### GitHub Spec Kit: "Good Thinking, Expensive Maintenance"

**The promise**: An open-source, agent-agnostic framework that makes specs executable — constitution + specify + plan + tasks + implement.

**The failure mode**: The constitution is a quiet success — immutable global constraints consistently enforced. The per-feature spec workflow is the problem. It generates verbose, highly detailed specifications that are [tedious to review](https://medium.com/@lookoutking/spec-driven-development-in-practice-my-experience-with-spec-kit-8f250b47d677) and [expensive to process](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/1492). One detailed experiment found [a sea of markdown documents, long agent run-times, and unexpected friction](https://medium.com/@lookoutking/spec-driven-development-in-practice-my-experience-with-spec-kit-8f250b47d677). Another measured [96 tasks generated for a simple Chrome extension](https://www.uncommonengineer.com/blog/2025/09/16/lessons-learned-the-complexity-wall/) — a plan that "completely missed the point."

Each feature gets its own spec branch, which means post-merge there is no unified spec that describes the system. The spec maintenance strategy is [left vague or totally open](https://medium.com/@lookoutking/spec-driven-development-in-practice-my-experience-with-spec-kit-8f250b47d677). Brownfield support requires [manual setup of a separate extension](https://github.com/wcpaxx/spec-kit-brownfield-extensions) that doesn't reflect actual architecture.

**The saving grace**: It's free, open-source, MIT-licensed, agent-agnostic, and community-driven (83,000+ GitHub stars). The constitution concept is genuinely valuable and worth borrowing regardless of whether you use the rest of the workflow.

**Who it works for**: Developers wanting a free, structured starting point for greenfield projects with well-defined scope. Good for learning spec-driven thinking. Not suited for long-lived projects where spec maintenance becomes the bottleneck, or for brownfield codebases.

## The Structural Comparison

For readers who want the feature matrix alongside the narrative, here is the capability comparison across the dimensions that drive long-term outcomes:

### What stays true over time?

| Dimension | VibeLoom | Traycer | Deep Trilogy | Tessl | Kiro | Spec Kit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec persistence** | Permanent — contract stack is the system's living model | Task-scoped — plans are useful during implementation | Session-scoped — artifacts on filesystem, not governed | Permanent per-file — spec-as-source by design | Feature-scoped — static after creation | Branch-scoped — no unified post-merge view |
| **Cross-feature coherence** | Context graph detects stale downstream when upstream changes | None — each plan is independent | None — each session starts fresh | None — per-file scope, no cross-file contracts | None — feature docs are independent | Constitution enforces global rules; per-feature specs are independent |
| **Drift detection** | Computed staleness from derivation graph | Post-implementation verification (code vs current plan only) | None | Prevented within files by design; not detectable across files | None documented | None |
| **Reconciliation** | Asymmetric: upstream truth governs; human chooses direction; bounded loop | Verification flags issues; agent re-implements | None | Regenerate code from edited spec | None | None |
| **Traceability** | Full chain: requirement → story → domain entity → component → test | Implicit: phase → plan → files | Implicit: requirement → spec → section | 1:1 spec-to-file | Numbered tasks trace to numbered requirements | Checklist-based, AI-interpreted |

### What scales with team and codebase size?

| Dimension | VibeLoom | Traycer | Deep Trilogy | Tessl | Kiro | Spec Kit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Multi-agent** | Native — module contracts with explicit ownership, graph-based context loading | Agent-agnostic orchestration — delegates to any coding agent | Sections parallelizable in theory; manual in practice | Registry provides shared context; no multi-agent coordination | Single-agent IDE | Agent-agnostic but no parallel coordination |
| **Context management** | Graph traversal loads minimal required scope | Plan-scoped — agent receives the plan | Per-section — manual context management between sections | Per-file spec scoping | Task-scoped; [context summarization triggers early](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/4758) | Task-scoped within spec branch |
| **New contributor onboarding** | Read intent → prd → dm → system to understand the system | Re-create plans for relevant areas | No persistent knowledge base | Read per-file specs (good for components; no system overview) | Read feature requirements (no system-level view) | Read constitution (good for rules; no system-level view) |
| **Domain modeling** | Full DDD: bounded contexts, aggregates, invariants, ubiquitous language | None | None | None | None | None |

### What controls ceremony and cost?

| Dimension | VibeLoom | Traycer | Deep Trilogy | Tessl | Kiro | Spec Kit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ceremony scaling** | 4 modes: vibe (compact stack, one approval) → expert (all gates) | Plan mode (simple) vs Epic mode (complex) | 3 entry points; no ceremony control within each | Single workflow | Single workflow; overkill for small changes | Single workflow; overkill for small changes |
| **Token efficiency** | Contract stack is structured; context graph limits what's loaded | Plans can [exceed downstream context windows](https://community.traycer.ai/) | Token-intensive (research + interview + external review) | Per-file is efficient; registry scales | Credit-metered; [tasks fail and restart from scratch](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/1284) | [Hits Claude Pro rate limits in hours](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/1492) |
| **Approval flexibility** | Mode-driven: delegated auto-advance with breaking-change escalation | Human approves plan before handoff | Interview checkpoints + code review triage | Human edits spec only | Human reviews each phase | Checklist-driven phase gates |

## Strategic Assessment

### VibeLoom's core advantage

VibeLoom addresses spec drift through continuous reconciliation driven by a context graph — a mechanism designed so that specs written in week 1 evolve rather than expire. Other tools produce specs that either decay (Traycer, Deep Trilogy, Kiro, Spec Kit) or operate at file scope without cross-component coherence (Tessl). The trade-off is upfront ceremony.

The context graph is the key differentiator. Without staleness detection and impact analysis, maintaining a multi-tier spec stack would be as futile as maintaining a separate requirements document — it would drift within weeks. The graph is designed to turn static specs into a living contract. Whether this works in practice at scale remains to be validated publicly.

### VibeLoom's core risks

1. **Ceremony**: Vibe mode reduces upfront cost to a compact two-tier stack (intent + flat system doc), but still requires more ceremony than prompt-only tools. The methodology rewards projects that survive long enough to compound the value of maintained specs. The one-way upgrade to the full contract stack is a bet on longevity.
2. **DDD prerequisite**: The contract stack uses bounded contexts, aggregates, and invariants natively. Teams without DDD experience face a steeper learning curve than with any other tool here. Traycer, Kiro, and Spec Kit require no specific domain modeling methodology.
3. **Discipline dependency**: The context graph detects drift but doesn't prevent it. If teams bypass reconciliation or edit code directly, the contract becomes stale like any other doc. The methodology's value depends on the team treating it as non-negotiable — which is a cultural bet, not a technical guarantee.
4. **Availability**: As of March 2026, VibeLoom is a methodology with public documentation but limited tooling availability. Competitors like Spec Kit (open-source, MIT, 83K stars), Traycer (VS Code extension, 100K+ users), and Kiro (publicly available IDE) have broader accessibility.

### What VibeLoom should learn from competitors

1. **From Traycer**: Agent-agnostic execution is valuable. Developers have preferred coding agents; the planning layer shouldn't force a specific one.
2. **From Spec Kit**: The constitution concept — immutable global constraints — maps cleanly to VibeLoom's `defaults` and is worth studying for patterns that make global rules easy to author and enforce.
3. **From Tessl**: The evaluation framework with quantitative metrics (35% improvement on API accuracy) provides the kind of concrete evidence that VibeLoom's eval framework should aspire to produce.
4. **From Kiro**: Agent hooks (automated actions on file events) are a practical integration pattern for connecting spec-driven workflows to CI/CD pipelines.
5. **From the community**: The [waterfall critique](https://marmelab.com/blog/2025/11/12/spec-driven-development-waterfall-strikes-back.html) is not wrong for tools that front-load massive documentation before any code ships. VibeLoom's vibe mode with a compact contract stack and delegated auto-advance is the right response, but the messaging needs to emphasize that contract-driven ≠ upfront-everything. The contract evolves; it's not a phase gate before coding begins.

## Landscape Summary

| Tool | Approach | Spec Lifetime | Governing Artifact | Key Strength | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VibeLoom** | Contract-driven | Permanent, evolving | Multi-tier contract stack with context graph | Specs stay accurate and governing over months/years | Upfront ceremony investment |
| **Traycer** | Plan-first, verify-after | Task-scoped | File-level plans | Fast per-task productivity with post-implementation verification | No cross-task coherence; plans don't compound |
| **Deep Trilogy** | Interview-driven planning | Session-scoped | Section files | Thorough upfront thinking via structured interviews | Manual orchestration; context loss between sessions |
| **Tessl** | Spec-as-source | Permanent per-file | Per-file spec | Zero drift within files; quantified accuracy improvement | No cross-file contracts or system-level coherence |
| **Kiro** | Structured IDE workflow | Feature-scoped | Requirements + design + tasks | Auditable spec trail for regulated environments | Static docs; unreliable task execution; context loss |
| **Spec Kit** | Constitution + phase workflow | Branch-scoped | Constitution + per-feature specs | Free, open-source, agent-agnostic; strong global constraints | Verbose specs; high token cost; no post-merge unified view |

### Who Is Each Tool Built For?

| Tool | Team size | Prerequisite knowledge | Best starting point | Switching cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VibeLoom** | 2-10+ (scales with context graph) | DDD concepts, tiered spec thinking | Greenfield; brownfield via `import` | High — contract stack is deeply integrated |
| **Traycer** | 1-5 (scales with human architect) | None beyond coding | Any existing codebase | Low — plans are independent of tool |
| **Deep Trilogy** | 1-2 (solo or pair) | Claude Code familiarity | Well-scoped new features | Low — plugins are optional add-ons |
| **Tessl** | 1-5 (per-file scope limits coordination) | Basic spec writing | Component libraries, SDK code | Medium — specs replace code as editable artifact |
| **Kiro** | 1-5 (single-agent IDE) | EARS notation (learnable) | Greenfield features in AWS ecosystem | Medium — IDE lock-in |
| **Spec Kit** | 1-10+ (constitution scales) | None | Greenfield projects | Low — open-source, agent-agnostic |

### SDD Maturity Positioning

Following [Böckeler's SDD maturity framework](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html), extended:

| Level | Definition | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec-first** | Spec written before code, then potentially discarded | Kiro, Deep Trilogy |
| **Spec-anchored** | Spec persists after the task for evolution and maintenance | Spec Kit (aspiring), Traycer (partially — verification re-checks plans) |
| **Spec-as-source** | Spec is primary artifact; humans never touch generated code | Tessl (exploring) |
| **Contract-driven** | Tiered specs actively govern generation, evaluation, reconciliation, and traceability across the full lifecycle | VibeLoom |
