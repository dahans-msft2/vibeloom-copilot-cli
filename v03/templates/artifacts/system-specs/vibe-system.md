<!--
VibeLoom template: system (vibe mode)
Tier: system-specs (vibe only)
Purpose: all-inclusive summary "technical" spec. Flat covering system context, containers, components, and structured local content.
Entities: CONT-#### and CMP-#### only (per methodology ## Modes ### Vibe Mode).

Note on scope: vibe keeps the derivation graph unmaterialized. EXT/TB/SNFR/interfaces/dependencies/behaviors appear as structured content in this one file rather than as distinct artifacts. Upgrade to pm/dev/ux/expert expands this into system + containers + per-container + per-component.

Generator guidance:
- Keep this tight. Vibe is a compromise between ceremony and structure.
- Each CONT derives from CAP (root entity type in vibe) or CST; each CMP derives from CONT + optional CAP.
- Inter-container communication paths and component-level interfaces/behaviors appear as tables but not as graph entities.
- Do not introduce BC, AGG, ENT, VO, INV, TERM, FR, NFR, EPIC, FLOW, STORY, ACC here — those only exist in full modes.
